- Database includes users table with automatic synchronization from auth.users via trigger function
- Authentication implemented with login/register pages and middleware protection
- API routes created for users, login, and registration endpoints
- Demo users available: demo1@example.com / demopassword123 and demo2@example.com / demopassword123
- Project structure organized with src/app for pages, src/lib for business logic, and src/utils for utilities
